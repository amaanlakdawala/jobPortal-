The 4P's will help a lot in the overall success of public speaking .
First of all we plan about the topic that we have got and will prepare what kind of information are we going to deliver 
Then we will pepare those information and will collect information from the internet and will prepare our presentation in the same manner as we have planned.
Then we will practise and will gain confidence and will improve where we are lacking so that we do not lack on the Main day where we will present
Then on the Main day we will present the topic in the manner as we haved practised 

Using these four steps we can achieve a successfull public speaking because we have covered all the points that can occur on the Main day and have prepared well for that day
