Planning:-
   It helps to plan the way we are going to present 
we prepare what we are going to discuss and how we are going to communicate with the audience and how to make our deliverable engaging.

Prepare:- After that we will prepare our presentation and do some resarch about the specific topic and will also use some graphs and statistics in our presentation and will also make use of bullet points. and will gather the relevent information from the internet. in this we will also prepare some answers for the question that can be asked by the audience.

Practice:- 
After that we will practise and make our self confident to deliver our best, and will try to improve where we are lacking and will also divide the content amoung the group members so that each one of us get the chance to present

Present:- After that the final day arrives where we have to present our topic and we will try to deliver in the same manner as we have prepared and practised to deliver.
